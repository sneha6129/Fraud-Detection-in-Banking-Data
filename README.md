#  Fraud Detection in Banking Data

The increasing use of digital banking services—such as online bank transfers, credit card transactions, and UPI payments—has made financial systems more vulnerable to fraud. Detecting these fraudulent activities in real time is crucial for protecting individuals and organizations from significant financial losses.

This project presents a **machine learning-based fraud detection system** that analyzes transactional data across three key domains:

- **Bank Account Transactions**
- **Credit Card Transactions**
- **UPI (Unified Payments Interface) Payments**

Each domain is powered by trained ML models to classify transactions as **legitimate** or **fraudulent** based on features such as transaction amount, time, device ID, location, and more.

The project is implemented as an interactive **web application using Streamlit**, and it is designed for end users such as **bank customers, financial analysts, and small businesses**. It features **user authentication via Supabase**, cloud deployment on **AWS** or **Hugging Face Spaces**, and provides a smooth interface for testing real-world or sample data for fraud risk.
